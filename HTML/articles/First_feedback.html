        <p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1726191639868_89">"Hello Maria,<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for submitting your “Who Am I?” form. The feedback given here is for you to use when you start the
            program, so you don’t have to respond to it just now.<br>
            <br>
            I read that your prior education was focused on Economic informatics, what have you learned so far? Did you
            already take our Programming Experience preparation assignment? <a
                href="https://learn.hz.nl/course/view.php?id=29015#section-5" class="_blanktarget" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">https://learn.hz.nl/course/view.php?id=29015#section-5</a> <br>
            <br>
            Our program for the first year focuses mostly on programming (HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, Laravel
            Framework) helping you not only to code but also to work as a professional team, with very hands-on approach
            working in some individual and many team project assignments.<br>
            <br>
            From your SWOT analysis I read you are a quick learner and keep lots of information. Do you also perform
            well when the subject is less interesting? On the other hand, you say you are easily distracted. Does this
            also happen when the subject is interesting? Do you get bored if it becomes too easy? How do you cope
            working with a team? <br>
            <br>
            You mention language level as a personal circumstance. But what is your English level? You must be able to
            follow the classes in this language, deliver well written reports, participate in team groups with a variety
            of nationalities, and take your exams in English. As described in the admission requirements, you need an
            equivalent to IELTS 6.0.<br>
            <br>
            You also ask about the classes: there are not many hours of lessons, but the program includes a lot of
            self-study and hands-on working on project development. For someone with some programming experience, it
            might seem a bit easy in the first quartile, but the workload gets quite intense further on. With
            Programming Basic, for example, you will get access to a knowledge bank that you will need to study before
            the class. In the morning, during class we will explain the theory deeper and show some practical examples.
            Then you get some small assignments to work on, in dividually and in a group. In the afternoon we come back
            to a check-point where we discuss the assignments and answer further questions. In the meantime, you work on
            your own delivering weekly assignments, that get more and more complex each week.<br>
