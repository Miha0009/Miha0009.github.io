        <h2>7 IT Career Paths and How to Get Started in 2024</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">It might be easy to assume that working in information technology (IT) means
            working in a tech office in a
            big city. But that's not the whole truth. IT skills are needed in places like hospitals, local
            governments,
            banks, and universities in smaller cities across the country. According to the US Bureau of Labor
            Statistics, about 377,500 job openings are projected each year on average in IT [1].<br>

            That said, the world of IT offers a variety of career paths in diverse industries. An IT professional
            can
            specialize in cybersecurity to keep computers safe, cloud computing to make information easier to
            access, or
            in help desk roles to assist in the everyday functions of an organization.</p>

        <h3>IT career paths</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Understanding what paths are available to you can help you navigate your
        first steps as you begin your
        career in IT.<br>

        Not sure where to start? Many IT professionals begin in generalist roles that cover a range of issues, like
        help desk technician or IT associate. You may get an entry-level IT certification to help you land one of
        these roles, though it's often not required. Once you've gained some experience and have a better grasp of
        what you like doing, you might think about focusing your career on a more specific area. You can explore
        entry-level IT jobs to see what other routes you can take if you're just starting out.<br>

        Job outlook information is sourced from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and applies to the period
        2022 to 2032, unless stated otherwise.<br>

            different
            aspects of computer operations. From there, it's possible to specialize in a narrower field like
            cybersecurity or networks, or continue in computer support to become a senior or manager.<br>
